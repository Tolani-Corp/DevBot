# Full Staff: Mission Command Center

## 🎯 Mission-Driven Operating System

Full Staff transforms your business from **task-oriented** to **mission-oriented**.

Instead of:
- "Fix bug in auth"
- "Update docs"
- "Hire 3 engineers"

You define:
- "Ship new feature by end of quarter"
- "Scale to 200 users"
- "Reduce churn from 2% to 1%"

Full Staff breaks down each mission into autonomous execution by the right team members.
