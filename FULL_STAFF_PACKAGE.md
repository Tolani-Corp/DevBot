# Full Staff™ - Your Virtual Business Team

## 🎯 The Concept

**Full Staff** is not a collection of bots. It's a **complete, AI-powered business team** that works together to execute your strategic goals from research & planning through daily operations.

Think of it as: **Your personal consulting firm + executive team + operations staff** that never sleeps, never gets distracted, and costs $99-2K/month instead of $500K/year.
