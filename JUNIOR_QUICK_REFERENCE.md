## 💡 Example: How Junior Works

### Scenario 1: Missing Approval

**Without Junior:**
```
9 AM: DevBot needs AWS credentials to deploy
      Posts request in #development
      CTO doesn't see it (checking email)
      10:15 AM: CTO finally checks Slack
      10:47 AM: CTO approves
      Result: 1.75 hour delay for one approval
```

**With Junior:**
```
9 AM: DevBot needs AWS credentials
     Junior detects: "Critical path blocker"
     Junior posts in #approvals: "@CTO urgent"
     9:12 AM: CTO responds
     9:13 AM: DevBot unblocked
     Result: 13 minute delay (85% faster)
```

### Scenario 2: Recurring Bottleneck

**Without Junior:**
```
Every Monday: Budget review takes 3 hours
Every Tuesday: Budget review takes 3 hours
Every Wednesday: Budget review takes 3 hours
Pattern: Executives manually review every budget
Result: 9 hours/week wasted on repetitive task
```

**With Junior:**
```
Junior analyzes: "Budget approvals <$50K are 99% approved"
Recommendation: "Auto-approve <$50K, escalate only >$50K"
Implementation: Junior auto-approves threshold items
Result: 90% fewer manual reviews (saves 8 hours/week)
```
