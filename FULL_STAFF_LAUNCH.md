## 🎁 Positioning by Audience

### For Founders
**"Scale faster without hiring executive deadweight"**

Founders spend 80% of their time on operations, 20% on strategy.
Full Staff automates the 80%, leaving you to be visionary.

```
Before Full Staff:
You handle: coding, hiring, finances, marketing, operations
Result: Burned out, slow

After Full Staff:
You focus on: Vision, strategy, investor relations
Full Staff handles: Everything else
Result: 10x velocity, energized
```

### For CEOs
**"Your executive team that never disagrees"**

Managing humans is hard. They have egos, off days, politics.
Full Staff is perfectly aligned to one goal: Execute your vision.

```
Human C-suite: $500K salary + benefits + politics + time
Full Staff: $999/mo + zero politics + perfect alignment + 24/7

You choose the mission.
Full Staff executes it perfectly.
Every time.
```

### For VCs
**"The company that built an executive team at scale"**

Investing in Tolani Labs = betting on a company that:
- Runs on 1/100th the ops cost of competitors
- Scales without hiring friction
- Can teach ALL portfolio companies this model

```
Your companies are slow because they're hiring to scale.
Full Staff lets them scale WITHOUT hiring.

Watch Tolani Labs grow 10x while competitors hire 10x people.
```

### For Enterprises
**"Augment your team without the hiring hassle"**

Enterprise needs: More capacity, but can't hire fast enough
Full Staff: 10 specialists, deployed instantly

```
Need 5 more senior engineers?
Hire 2, get 3 from Full Staff.

Need new CFO for 6 months while you search?
Full Staff CFO works your exact financial workflow.

No hiring. No onboarding. No politics. Instant.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Tolani Labs Launches "Full Staff" - 
Virtual Executive Team for Every Company

San Francisco, CA - February 2026

Tolani Labs announced the launch of Full Staff, an AI-powered 
virtual business team that brings together 10 specialists 
(CTO, COO, CFO, CMO, CHRO, and more) working autonomously to 
execute strategic goals.

Full Staff combines autonomous development (DevBot), operations 
management (OpsBot), financial planning (FinBot), marketing 
automation (BuzzBot), and team scaling (HRBot) into one 
unified system.

Key benefits:
- 24/7 operations (never sleeps)
- Executive team coordination (perfectly aligned)
- Cost reduction (100x cheaper than hiring)
- Speed to execution (hours not months)
- Scalability (grows with you)

Pricing starts at $99/month for startups, $299/month for 
growing companies, and custom pricing for enterprise.

"We built Full Staff to solve a problem we faced: as we 
scaled, we needed more executives but couldn't find them fast 
enough or afford the cost," said Terri, CEO of Tolani Labs.

"Instead, we built an AI executive team that's always 
available, perfectly aligned, and costs 1% of hiring real 
executives."

Full Staff is live today at fullstaff.ai
